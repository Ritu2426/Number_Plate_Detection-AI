# Number_Plate_Detection-AI
 A Simple Computer Vision Project on Number Plate Detection from an image.<br><br>
 <p> It includes:</p>
 <p> 1) Images folder: Where one can find images which I have used in testing the GUI. </p>
 <p> 2) gui.py: Main file for GUI.</p>
 <p> 3) main.py: It includes basic idea behind the number plate detection.</p>
 <p> 4) updatedmain.py: Used to test accuracy of my code.</p>
 <br>
 <p>--> Libraries Used: cv2, imutils, numpy, pytesseract.</p>
 <p>--> Meaning of each line is mentioned in the main.py. One can use that to understand the logic behind the code.</p>
